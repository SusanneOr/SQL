#Customer & Order Analytics Project
#In this project, IÂ´m querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

/**How many orders were placed in January?**/
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID<>"Order ID";

/**How many of those orders were for an iPhone?**/
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product="Iphone"
AND length(orderID)=6
AND orderID<>"Order ID";

/**Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.**/
SELECT customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id=Febsales.orderID
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID<>"Order ID";

/**Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?**/
SELECT product, min(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price asc
LIMIT 1
;

/**What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? **/
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)*price AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan
GROUP BY product
;

/** Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?**/
SELECT product, sum(quantity), sum (quantity)*price AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.Febsales
WHERE location= "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY product
;

/**How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?**/
SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum), 
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
